# A Typescript + Tailwind Next.js template

A template with all the libraries and configurations I love and use to build a fullstack app in <u>minutes<u/>.

## Getting Started

First, download dependencies by running:

```zsh
yarn
```

Next, run the development server on localhost 3000:

```zsh
yarn dev
```
